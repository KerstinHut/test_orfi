## Opening up resources in medical imaging: Towards open, unified methods to evaluate algorithms and datasets
Medical imaging is one of the many fields where modern algorithms, often based on machine learning, are developed and applied daily to solve challenging problems. The special challenge with medical applications are the inevitably stricter requirements regarding their safety. Still, unified approaches for the evaluation of these algorithms are sparse. It is not only the lack of methods and workflows, however, that stand in the way of innovative, wide-spread approaches. The vast number and variety of these algorithms, paired with a lack of data availability, makes it hard to even gather these algorithms, let alone develop an evaluation environment. It has become near impossible to gather a complete list and some useful resources are hard to find, making the search for algorithms and datasets time-consuming and inefficient. 

To tackle this bottleneck, we introduce Open Resources for Imaging, an open source platform to find and share algorithms and datasets in medical imaging from community for the community. We want to promote open science by making published resources easily available, thereby promoting unified methods and comparability among the resources.

Science is a comparative environment. But collaboration and competition don't have to be exclusive! Let's leverage the possibilities of open science by elevating each and every project in providing the necessary information to be compatible and develop better, safer algorithms.
